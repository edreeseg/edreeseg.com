          <p>Hi, I'm Ed. I'm a full stack web developer with an interest in designing intuitive user interfaces, implementing efficient logic in data handling, and watching projects come alive through hard work and careful planning.</p>
          <p>I was lucky enough to be introduced to the field of web development by a close friend, who recommended it as a valuable skill to learn in my spare time.  I knew almost immediately that I wanted to make a career change, and invested myself wholly in my studies from that point forward.</p>
          <p>I have practical experience working in a team environment to build web applications using technologies such as React, Node, and PostgreSQL.  Iâ€™m always looking to accumulate knowledge and examine how I can apply that knowledge to my own projects.</p>
